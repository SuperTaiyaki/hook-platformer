Platformer demo

Requirements:
OpenGL libraries
FreeGLUT and GLEW
Python > 2.6 (for editing levels only)

Tested with:
-FreeGLUT 2.8.1
-GLEW 1.10.0
-gcc/g++ 4.8.1
under Arch Linux (x86_64)

Building:
if SConstruct is available:
$ scons
A Makefile is also available, though not guaranteed to be up to date.
Otherwise, just building all the .cc files and linking with GL, freeglut and
GLEW should do it.

I suspect this will build fine under Windows, but I'm not set up to find out.

Controls:
WASD/,AOE (dvorak) for movement.
Space for jump. Holding it will cause the player to bounce on any impact.
Left mouse to fire the hook towards the mouse cursor. Left mouse again to retract.
If the hook has connected to something, hold right mouse to pull it in.
r to reset the level

Both stages can be completed in under 30 seconds.

Editing levels:
Stages are SVG, processed with convert_svg.py . Only rectangular geometry
(<rect> nodes) are permitted. A node with id 'goal' and 'border' (the outside
bounds of the stage - where the player falls out of the level) are required. A
text node with text 'start' indicates the player start position.
